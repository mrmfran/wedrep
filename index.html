        <p><a href="https://bambulab.com/en">Bambu Lab</a> printers are one of the best 3D printers you can buy today.
        They dont come cheap but for their price, having an AMS (Automatic Material System) makes printing multi-colored
        projects very easy as you dont have to stop a print, remove the current filament and replace it with the new color. 
        When I started 3D printing weeks ago, I was using an AnkerMake M5 and I really thought it was the best 3D printer 
        (It was my first machine) until my friends and family who was into 3D printing told me to try Bambu lab.The moment 
        I did my first print on the Bambu lab A5, I was just blown away with the quality of it. The machine was too quiet 
        as if you were'nt printing at all. Print Quality was 9/10. I was so amazed that not even 30 minutes after my first
        print, I went online again and purchased Bambu lab's flagship model which is the Bambu Lab X1 Carbon. Now this 
        machine is on a different level.
        </p>

        <p>If the A1 is a 9/10, the X1 Carbon is lightyears away from 10. Thats how crazy this bad boy is.</p>

            <li>Filaments</li>
            <li>Scrapers</li>
            <li>Heat plate</li>
            <li>Spool</li>
