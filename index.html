                    <a href="https://bambulab.com/en" target="_blank">Bambu Lab</a> printers are one of the best 3D printers you can buy today.
                    They don't come cheap, but for their price, having an AMS (Automatic Material System) makes printing multi-colored
                    projects very easy as you don't have to stop a print, remove the current filament, and replace it with the new color.
            When I started 3D printing weeks ago, I was using an AnkerMake M5 and I really thought it was the best 3D printer 
            (It was my first machine) until my friends and family, who were into 3D printing, told me to try Bambu Lab. The moment 
            I did my first print on the Bambu Lab A5, I was just blown away by the quality. The machine was so quiet 
            as if you weren't printing at all. Print Quality was 9/10. I was so amazed that not even 30 minutes after my first
            print, I went online again and purchased Bambu Lab's flagship model, which is the Bambu Lab X1 Carbon. Now this 
            machine is on a different level.

        <h3 id="if">If the A1 is a 9/10, the X1 Carbon is lightyears away from 10. That's how crazy this bad boy is.</h3>
        <p>A couple of my <a href="video.html"> Timelapse Compilations </a></p>
        <p>Bambu Lab's 3D printers from flagship to base:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>X1 Carbon (with AMS)</li>
            <li>X1 Carbon</li> 
            <li>P1S Combo (with AMS)</li>
            <li>P1S</li>
            <li>P1P</li>
            <li>A1 Combo (with AMS)</li>a
            <li>A1</li>
            <li>A1 Mini Combo</li>
            <li>A1 Mini</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3D printing requires the following:</p>
