                        <p>The white Vase is what my sister was looking for so I looked up online and printed one for her.</p>
                        <p>The white moon shaped phone stand is a nice stand but the only bad thing about it is if you over turn
                        the knob, the dial will come off as it does not have any stopper. I am going to modify it to be able to stop it</p>
                        <p>Swatch holder is the one I printed to hold all the colored swatches included in the A1 combo</p>
                        <p>Scraper from the internal storage of the printer. This one of the fist things you should print before somebody starts
                        printing on any machine</p>
                        <p>Ofcourse! A Benchie! this is always the first one to be printed on every 3d printers for some reason. 
                        Why? I really have no clue but im going to find the reason why.</p>
