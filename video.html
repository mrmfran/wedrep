                    <p>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game/puzzle consisting of 3 rods and a number of disks which comes in various
                        sizes that can slide into any rod. Basic rule is you can transfer any disk to any rod but the disk underneath it
                        must be a bigger size disk than the one going on top of it. Main objective is to transfer the whole stack on a
                        different rod than where you started while following the basic rule.

                    <p>I was looking for a good pegboard mount for my Dualsense edge controller but couldnt find one and then I realized
                        that I have a printer which can print anything so why not print my own mount?
