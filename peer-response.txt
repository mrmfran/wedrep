1.  Under about.html(former clickme.html), utilizing the alt description would benefit visually impaired users. I added alt descriptions.

2. Adjusted Flexible layouts to enhance responsiveness in the "about" section. 

3. Moved the comments of the images of the ABOUT page below the image.

4. Inserted a background image of the bambulab logo, made it a little bit transparent so the description can still be read by the user.
